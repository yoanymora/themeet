# The Meet
Front end practice: website using html5, css, bootstrap4 and js.

To fully complete this practice 6 pages were made, and each page was prooved in 4 different devices with different sizes to practice responsiveness. The design of the web pages was taken from the third practice of the course *"Build beautiful websites easier and faster using bootstrap 4"*.

Feel free to download this repo if you want to check the responsiveness of the pages.

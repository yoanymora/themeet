# themeet
Front end practice: website using html5, css, bootstrap4 and js.
To fully complete this practice 6 pages were made, and each page was prooved in 4 different devices with different sizes to practice responsiveness.
The design of the web pages was taken from the third practice of the course "Build beautiful websites easier and faster using bootstrap 4".
Feel free to download this repo if you want to check the responsiveness of the pages.
